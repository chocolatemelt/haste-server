# nori
a personal fork of [haste-server](https://github.com/seejohnrun/haste-server).
features neat "improvements" such as:

 * japanese gfycat naming
 * new colorscheme
 * gulp minify tasks
 * a bunch of random html/css fixes
 * no longer renders in quirks mode. seriously, why?

if these features are not important to you then by all means use the original hastebin :)
