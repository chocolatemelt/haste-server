# nori
this is a fork of [hastebin](https://hastebin.com/) with some really trifling improvements such as:

 * japanese gfycat naming scheme
 * a bunch of mild performance improvements
 * a different colorscheme
 * random ux fixes that the original authors deemed unnecessary, apparently
 * no longer renders in quirks mode

otherwise, this works like hastebin, which is pretty intuitive imo.

this has a post api at `/documents`. just hand it whatever you feel like pasting and it'll give you
the key to the file, which you can then access at `https://nori.nisemo.no/{key}`. you can set up a
nice shell function to do this for you a la ptpb.pw (r.i.p.)

pastes currently do not expire. if you need something removed just let me know.

don't be stupid. thanks =)

w @ nisemo.no for various inquiries
