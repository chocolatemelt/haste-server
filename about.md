# nori
this is a fork of [hastebin](https://hastebin.com/) with some really trifling improvements such as:
 * japanese gfycat naming scheme
 * a bunch of mild performance improvements
 * a different colorscheme
 * random ux fixes that the original authors deemed unnecessary, apparently
 * no longer renders in quirks mode

otherwise, this works like hastebin, which is pretty intuitive imo
